If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information. Which of the following statements accurately depicts the relationship between Gauss's law, electric flux, electric field, and symmetry in electric fields? A. Gauss's law holds only for situations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, and doesn't apply to other field types. Electric flux, as an expression of the total electric field passing through a closed surface, is influenced only by charges within the surface and unaffected by distant charges located outside it. The scalar quantity electric flux is strictly measured in SI fundamental quantities as kg·m3·s−3·A. B. Gauss's law holds in all cases, but it is most useful for calculations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, as they allow for simpler algebraic manipulations. Electric flux is not affected by distant charges outside the closed surface, whereas the net electric field, E, can be influenced by any charges positioned outside of the closed surface. In SI base units, the electric flux is expressed as kg·m3·s−3·A−1. C. Gauss's law, which applies equally to all electric fields, is typically most useful when dealing with symmetric field configurations, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, since it makes it easier to calculate the total electric flux. Electric flux, an expression of the total electric field through a closed surface, is unaffected by charges outside the surface, while net electric field, E, may be influenced by charges located outside the closed surface. Electric flux is expressed in SI base units as kg·m3·s−1·C. D. Gauss's law only holds for electric fields with cylindrical symmetry, like those of a straight long wire; it is not applicable to fields with other types of symmetry. Electric flux, which measures the total electric field across a closed surface, is influenced by all charges within the surface as well as by those located outside it. The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−2·A−1. E. Gauss's law, which holds for all situations, is most beneficial when applied to electric fields that exhibit higher degrees of symmetry, like those with cylindrical and spherical symmetry. While electric flux is unaffected by charges outside of a given closed surface, the net electric field, E, may be affected by them. The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−1·C.",E
